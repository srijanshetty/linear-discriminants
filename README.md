# Discriminant Analysis

## Generation of Waveforms
- To generate waveforms we use Breiman's original waveform generation function which is available at UCI's [Machine Learning repositiory](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Waveform+Database+Generator+(Version+2)).
- The waveform generator is available in the R package **[mlbench]**(http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/r-help/library/mlbench/html/mlbench.waveform.html) as *mlbench.waveform*
